# KSW-ToolKit

![screenshot](/images/screenshot-eventmanager.png)

KSW-ToolKit is an extension to your KSW Android screen. Once the service is installed, it will hijack the original McuService and will work as replacement which you can highly customize. This service allows you to remap your buttons to invoke various Android keystrokes, start any App of your desire or invoke various MCU hardware commands like switching sources or tuning the brightness. The service also bypasses various inconveniances the original McuService caused, like not hearing your Android when you're in OEM side, keeping your Apps open when you switch sources or generally having the Android react faster to your hardware inputs.

...in short KSW-ToolKit
## Features:
* Rich customizability
* Remapping of your hardware buttons
* Automatic Day/Night switching
* Auto Volumes
* Sound Restorer to keep sound running on OEM side
* Enables extra hardware buttons*
* Built in ADB Shell to manipulate and have more control over your Android
* And much more to discover...

*This is the "Media-Button Hack". It will depend on the car and MCU model you have. In BMWs for example this hack will allow the Tel and Media/CD button on your iDrive to also get triggered as Phone and MODE event in Android. Check MCU Listener if this hack works for you.
